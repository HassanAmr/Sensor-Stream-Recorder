### TODOs

- [ ] Initialize the recorder's arguments using real command-line options.
- [ ] Add an option to use a scheduled recording plan (e.g. 0s - 20s: no gesture, 20s - 40s: gestureA, 40s - 60s: no gesure, etc..)
- [ ] maybe add a gif image to explain how the recorder works
- [ ] Edit the help section to make it more appealing
- [ ] Replace opencv for something that can create `.mkv`
- [ ] Make plotting more useful
